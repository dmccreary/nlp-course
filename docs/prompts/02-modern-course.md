# Natural Language Processing with Python PyTorch: Course Outline

!!! prompt
    Create an outline for a modern college level course on Natural Language processing with Python PyTorch. Assume that students all have access to many generative AI tools and agentic IDEs to generate Python code.  Assume that we will use generative AI tools to generate a large amount of Python PyTorch code.

    Do not spend much time on traditional rules-based NLP programs and skim over topic such as identifying parts of speech, Stemming and lemmatization, Stop word removal, regular expressions for text processing, TF-IDF etc.

    Place a strong focus on using large-language-models (LLMs) to solve NLP problems.  Cover transformers and attention in depth.

    Discuss the details of how to create high-quality generative AI prompts to create precise Python PyTorch code.

    Emphasize the processes around converting text into Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and the use of graph databases and the graph query language Cypher to analyze text.

    Focus on ways to measure and improve the quality of NLP processes.

    Assume that the students has some exposure to Python and can read generated Python code.

    Wrap up with student projects that solve real-world business applications.
