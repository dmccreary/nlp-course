Here's a detailed course description for a college course catalog on Natural Language Processing with Python:

# Natural Language Processing with Python

**Instructor:** Dan McCreary  
**Credits:** 4  
**Prerequisites:** Python, Data Structures, Machine Learning or instructor permission   

## Catalog Description

This course provides a comprehensive exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) theory and application using Python programming. Students will examine how computers process, analyze, and generate human language through computational and linguistic approaches. The course covers fundamental NLP techniques from traditional rule-based methods to modern deep learning approaches, with emphasis on practical implementation.

Students will gain hands-on experience with industry-standard Python libraries including Pytorch. Topics include text preprocessing, language modeling, text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and dialogue systems. The course does not spend much time on traditional rules-based NLP techniques and puts a focus on contemporary generative AI systems.  We use generative AI tools to generate sample Python Pytorch code.

Throughout the semester, students will develop increasingly sophisticated NLP applications, culminating in a final project that addresses a real-world language processing challenge. The ethical implications of NLP technologies, including bias, privacy concerns, and responsible deployment, will be integrated throughout the curriculum.

## Course Format

The course combines theoretical lectures with hands-on lab sessions. Each week includes one 110-minute lecture focusing on core concepts and one 110-minute lab session dedicated to implementation and problem-solving. Students will complete weekly programming assignments, a midterm project, a research presentation, and a comprehensive final project that demonstrates mastery of course concepts.

Dan McCreary brings extensive industry experience in applied NLP, having led language processing initiatives at several technology firms before joining the faculty. Guest speakers from industry and research institutions will provide additional perspectives on current NLP applications and research frontiers.

## Note on Generative AI

This course acknowledges and incorporates the reality of generative AI tools in the computational landscape. Students are permitted and encouraged to use generative AI tools as learning aids, with appropriate documentation. However, assessments are designed to evaluate deep understanding beyond what generative tools alone can provide. Dan McCreary will provide clear guidelines for appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI assistance for each assignment.
