## Special Notes on Generative AI Use
- Generative AI tools may be used for code assistance, debugging, and generating ideas
- All work must include critical analysis of AI-generated content
- Assignments will include components that evaluate students' understanding beyond what generative AI can provide
- Students must cite and document all AI-assisted components of their work
- Some assessments will be designed as "AI-free zones" to evaluate independent skills
