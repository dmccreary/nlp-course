# Document Classification Architecture

!!! prompt
    What architecture would you recommend for this application?  Please specify what data you would need for input such as known documents with classification labels as well as training process for a classification model as well as what types of ways we can measure the success of these classification models.

I'll provide a recommended architecture for a document classification system, including required data inputs, training process, and evaluation metrics.

Document Classification System Architecture
===========================================

System Architecture Overview
----------------------------

I recommend a modular architecture with the following components:

1.  Data Ingestion Pipeline
2.  Preprocessing Module
3.  Feature Extraction Module
4.  Classification Model
5.  Evaluation Framework
6.  Inference Engine
7.  User Interface/API

## Required Data Inputs

### Labeled Document Dataset

-   **Training Set**: A substantial collection of documents with known classification labels
-   **Validation Set**: Separate labeled documents for tuning hyperparameters
-   **Test Set**: Holdout labeled documents for final evaluation

### Dataset Characteristics

-   Balanced representation across all target classes
-   Sufficient samples per class (minimum 100 documents per class)
-   Documents similar to those expected in production
-   Coverage of edge cases and ambiguous examples

## Training Process

### 1. Data Preprocessing

-   Text cleaning (removing HTML, special characters)
-   Tokenization
-   Stopword removal (optional)
-   Lemmatization/stemming (optional)
-   Handling of multilingual content if applicable

### 2. Feature Extraction

**Traditional Approaches:**

-   TF-IDF vectorization
-   N-gram extraction
-   Topic modeling features (LDA)

**Modern Approaches:**

-   Pretrained embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
-   Contextual embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.)
-   Document-level embeddings

### 3. Model Selection

**Traditional Models:**

-   Logistic Regression
-   Support Vector Machines
-   Random Forests

**Deep Learning Models:**

-   Convolutional Neural Networks
-   Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM/GRU)
-   Transformer-based models (fine-tuned BERT, etc.)

### 4. Training Pipeline

-   Cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
-   Learning rate scheduling
-   Early stopping
-   Model checkpointing
-   Regularization techniques

Evaluation Metrics
------------------

### Classification Performance

-   **Accuracy**: Overall correctness (suitable for balanced datasets)
-   **Precision**: Correctness of positive predictions (per class)
-   **Recall**: Completeness of positive predictions (per class)
-   **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
-   **Macro/Micro/Weighted Averages**: Aggregated metrics across classes

### Confusion Matrix Analysis

-   Identifying commonly confused classes
-   Class-specific performance analysis

### Advanced Evaluation

-   **ROC Curves and AUC**: For binary classification tasks
-   **Precision-Recall Curves**: Especially for imbalanced datasets
-   **Calibration Curves**: Assessing probability estimates

### Production-Oriented Metrics

-   **Inference Time**: Processing time per document
-   **Memory Usage**: Resource requirements
-   **Scalability**: Performance under high load
-   **Throughput**: Documents processed per time unit

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

### Model Explainability

-   Feature importance analysis
-   LIME or SHAP for local explanations
-   Attention visualization for transformer models

### Deployment Strategy

-   Containerization (Docker)
-   Model versioning and experiment tracking
-   A/B testing framework
-   Monitoring for model drift

### Continuous Improvement

-   Regular retraining schedule
-   Active learning for efficient labeling of new data
-   Feedback loop from production predictions

This architecture provides a comprehensive framework for building a robust document classification system that can be evaluated effectively and deployed with confidence.
